 MONUMENT_183_NAME: "Goodsprings"
 MONUMENT_183_DESC: "The §Y$MONUMENT_183_NAME$§! is a fixture of the Mojave landscape almost as old, if not older than many of its residents, developed as a mining town under the NCR. So named after the Goodsprings source, where the town gets its drinking water"
 MONUMENT_184_NAME: "Yangtze Memorial"
 MONUMENT_184_DESC: "When American forces invaded the Chinese mainland during the Sino-American War in 2074, the intense fighting that occurred during the Yangtze Campaign consumed many lives on both sides of the conflict; The §Y$MONUMENT_184_NAME$§! was later erected in the state of Nevada sometime before October 23, 2077 to honor the fallen American troops."
 MONUMENT_185_NAME: "Vault 3"
 MONUMENT_185_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_185_NAME$§! was one of five vaults constructed by the Vault-Tec Corporation in the broader Mojave region assigned to house a civilian population, along with Vault 11, Vault 19, Vault 21, and Vault 34, as well as one of two vaults constructed in proximity to the Las Vegas Strip, along with Vault 21. Nestled amidst the blocks of South Vegas, Vault 3 was intended as one of the seventeen "control" vaults, so it was not given any parameters for the social experiments that notoriously plagued most other Vaults."
 MONUMENT_186_NAME: "Bitter Springs"
 MONUMENT_186_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_186_NAME$§! was Originally a state-run park with a nearby recreational area. Now a small settlement."
 MONUMENT_187_NAME: "Black Mountain"
 MONUMENT_187_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_187_NAME$§! was host to a military communications array and monitoring station focused on China's satellite network prior to the Great War. When the bombs fell, it was shielded from a direct strike by the mountain ridges but was left highly irradiated from the fallout thereafter. Post-War, following the fall of the Master in 2162, many of the first generation super mutants from Mariposa Military Base headed east, led by Marcus. Coming to the Mojave and eventually arriving at Black Mountain, they discovered the array was still operational and the mountain's natural structure provided a secluded and defensible place in which to settle, so it was there that Marcus decided to try and create a mutant sanctuary, similar but not quite like his former township of Broken Hills."
 MONUMENT_188_NAME: "Boulder City Monument"
 MONUMENT_188_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_188_NAME$§! Circa 2277, the New California Republic, in a decisive attack against Caesar's Legion during the First Battle of Hoover Dam, lured the bulk of the enemy into Boulder City, most of which was filled with high explosives, and detonated them, destroying the Legion's assault at the cost of many troopers who could not escape in time. Following the battle, the New California Republic built the memorial to honor the 107 Rangers and service members who lost their lives that day. Situated at the northwestern edge of Boulder City, right next to the Big Horn Saloon, the memorial is etched out of a slab of concrete and constantly lit by lights placed at its base. Each of the fallen is listed by name and rank on the side facing the Colorado River, while the inscription and the insignia of the NCR Army and the Rangers are carved into the side facing New California."
 MONUMENT_189_NAME: "Camp McCarran"
 MONUMENT_189_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_189_NAME$§!, formerly known as McCarran International Airport was Once in service to the American people's need for air travel, after the nuclear apocalypse, the former airport and its grounded crafts sat unused until the 2270s, when the New California Republic was brought to the negotiation table by Mr. House and created the New Vegas Treaty, which among its concessions gave control of the old transport hub to the New California Republic Army as their regional headquarters. By 2281, despite its strategic importance including a direct connection to the New Vegas Strip via a monorail, the troopers find themselves under constant siege from the savage Fiends tribe harassing their perimeter and patrols from a stronghold in the South Vegas ruins."
 MONUMENT_190_NAME: "Camp Searchlight"
 MONUMENT_190_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_190_NAME$§! At the breakout of the Great War, the bombs' destruction forced the Searchlight police department to divert a convoy carrying nuclear waste from San Onofre into Searchlight, so that the waste could be safely stored. The trucks could be parked at the fire station without exposing them to nuclear blasts that would have potentially turned the sealed, secure fuel casks into massive dirty bombs. The spent nuclear fuel rods remained there for over two centuries. When the New California Republic deployed in force to the Mojave during their Mojave Campaign, Searchlight was chosen as a site for a military base. "Camp Searchlight" was established, becoming a major communications and logistics hub for the NCR Army in the southern Mojave."
 MONUMENT_191_NAME: "Cottonwood Cove"
 MONUMENT_191_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_191_NAME$§! was once a small resort location before the Great War. The cove serves as both a military outpost protecting access to Fortification Hill."
 MONUMENT_192_NAME: "Helios One"
 MONUMENT_192_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_192_NAME$§! was Established before the Great War by Poseidon Energy as a next-generation solar power plant to generate and provide power to the Las Vegas Strip and the regional power grid, hailed as the "Dawn of a Golden Age". HELIOS One was more than just a renewable source of energy. It doubled as a research and development facility for two of the US Army's top-secret projects: a laser turret defense system, ARCHIMEDES, and an experimental orbital bombardment laser satellite, ARCHIMEDES II. Having joined the "Poseidon Family" when they began work, employees of HELIOS One were expected to keep company projects a secret, as carelessly discussing developments could pose a threat to national security if China got wind of intel on Poseidon projects. Seeking military secrets that lay dormant since the Great War, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel occupied this old Poseidon Energy building under the order of their then-elder, Father Elijah in the 2270s."
 MONUMENT_193_NAME: "Hidden Valley Bunker"
 MONUMENT_193_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_193_NAME$§! was one of the four individual bunkers are situated in a cardinal direction of Hidden Valley and protected by the pre-War DERVISH camouflage system which serves as a cloaking mechanism for the bunkers within. In the event that the location was threatened, the bunker's DERVISH camouflage system would make targeting the site impossible for automated systems. These bunkers contain the CANDLE fusion power system, providing power for an estimated 752 years.\nOver the next two centuries following the Great War, the bunkers were abandoned and fell into disrepair, with large parts of the installation caving in due to lack of structural maintenance, salvaging, or design. It was not until the 2260s and the arrival of the newly founded Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel, under the command of their then-elder, Elijah, that the north bunker gained a new lease on life, set up as an auxiliary location and fallback point for the chapter, second in strategic value to HELIOS One."
 MONUMENT_194_NAME: "Hoover Dam"
 MONUMENT_194_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_194_NAME$§! also called the Old World Wall is a pre-War hydroelectric dam that weathered the nuclear apocalypse largely intact, its capacity to supply massive amounts of power to the wasteland has led to the dam serving as a point of contention between the rivaling regional powers. The Followers of the Apocalypse mentioned the continued existence of Hoover Dam as early as 2170. The Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel initially had plans to claim the dam themselves but became sidetracked by Father Elijah's experimenting with the power plant at HELIOS One. In the meantime, scouts of the New California Republic arrived at Hoover Dam, causing Mr. House to spur into action at the sign of civilization. \nHouse worried about the independence of his new city's power source, but the arrival of Caesar's Legion in the region meant that the NCR could not take the dam and the Strip without leaving them vulnerable to the Legion. When the NCR arrived in the Mojave to the dam en masse in 2274, Mr. House was waiting with a force of his Securitrons and members of the Three Families, but not to fight, rather to negotiate. Through diplomacy, House and the NCR drew up the Treaty of New Vegas, legislating that 95% of the dam's power output would be sent to the inner territories of the NCR, the other 5% continuing to power New Vegas, and in return House would retain his sovereignty over the Strip along with providing unrestricted access to the casinos for NCR citizens."
 MONUMENT_195_NAME: "JacobsTown"
 MONUMENT_195_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_195_NAME$§! was originally a resort location nestled amidst the cliffs of Mount Charleston, post-War, the area was of little interest to travelers and scavengers due to its remote location and lack of salvageable material. It was not until around the early 2270s that the place became a permanent settlement for any group."
 MONUMENT_196_NAME: "Mojave Outpost"
 MONUMENT_196_DESC: "Located near the state line of California and Nevada, before the Great War, the structure served as a rest stop and checkpoint along Interstate 15. After the war, now-derelict vehicles remain along the interstate and at the checkpoint.\nOver two centuries later, the location is under the control of the New California Republic, renamed "NCR Ranger Outpost Mojave," but typically truncated to just §Y$MONUMENT_196_NAME$§! The outpost features the Unification Monument, a visible and distinctive feature commemorating the historic merging of the Desert Rangers of Nevada and the New California Republic Rangers. Circa. 2271, representatives from the two groups met here to establish terms of the Ranger Unification Treaty, joining forces against the threat of the Legion. Under the treaty, the Desert Rangers were absorbed into the NCR with access to their resources in exchange for NCR extending its jurisdiction to southern Nevada, New Vegas and the Hoover Dam"
 MONUMENT_197_NAME: "NCR Correctional Facility"
 MONUMENT_197_DESC: "Before the Great War, the structure was known as the Jean Conservancy, a low-security all-female state prison in Nevada.\nA short time into the Mojave Campaign after 2253, the New California Republic Army commandeered the abandoned facility to house prisoners on a work-release program. The inmates were tasked with maintaining a railroad alongside the Long 15 under military supervision, keeping the vital link between the Boneyard and New Vegas alive."
 MONUMENT_198_NAME: "Nelson"
 MONUMENT_198_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_198_NAME$§! was a mining camp and town itself are enclosed by a chainlink fence and surrounded by bunkers made from sandbags. The tallest point in Nelson lies up a hill on the northern edge of town, there are various surviving houses amongst the settlement that serve a variety of purposes."
 MONUMENT_199_NAME: "Nipton"
 MONUMENT_199_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_199_NAME$§! pre-war was small town near the state line of Nevada and California, in San Bernardino County, California, Nipton was originally founded on February 9, 1905, as a stop on the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. Originally called "Nippeno Camp" following a nearby discovery of gold, the name was changed to Nipton when the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad merged with the Union Pacific Railroad around 1910. The town and depot also supplied ranches and mines in the area, becoming a social center for the sparse population of the region. It eventually became a tourist destination, offering hikers and travelers a place to restock, park their RVs and set up their tents. Those willing to test their luck could partake in the California state lottery and potentially win a jackpot worth millions of dollars.\nPost-War Most of Nipton's buildings were left intact following the Great War, allowing it to remain as a small, but robust presence along the trade routes."
 MONUMENT_200_NAME: "Novac"
 MONUMENT_200_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_200_NAME$§! was One of the few notable stops along the old Highway 95, its landmark Dinky the T-Rex statue and Dino Dee-lite Motel served as a commercial draw both before and after the nuclear apocalypse. Established alongside Highway 95, the "town" was once just a small stopover point for travelers looking for a restroom, a motel, or a coolant refill on the way to the REPCONN test site. Dinky the Dinosaur and the "World's 2nd Largest Thermometer" served as a novelty roadside attraction.\nAfter the Great War, the motel and surrounding area was resettled and Novac was founded, taking its name from the broken sign by the entrance."
 MONUMENT_201_NAME: "Primm"
 MONUMENT_201_DESC: "Often touted as the "poor man's Vegas", both before and after the bombs, in the 23rd century the town saw a surge of financial success from its location along Interstate 15 and proximity to the Mojave Outpost managing the caravan traffic to and from the Core Regions of the New California Republic. Before the Great War, Primm was a small resort town located in Clark County, Nevada, sitting alongside Interstate 15 connecting Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Quickly garnering a reputation as a "poor man's Las Vegas", Primm allowed tourists from California to get a taste of "Sin City" on the way in or lose what remained of their savings on the way out. The resort had a number of tourist attractions to boost its appeal, including the Vikki and Vance Casino, dedicated to a pair of outlaws who were the southwest answer to Bonnie and Clyde, and the Bison Steve Casino and Hotel boasting the Mojave region's largest and most rickety rollercoaster, El Diablo.\nThe town lost much of its appeal after the nuclear apocalypse, as survivors and later wastelanders had other concerns besides gambling their meager earnings away. Primm however remained, even developing a small, tightly knit community over time. In the late 23rd century, as the New California Republic expanded into the Mojave from New California, Primm's proximity to the Mojave Outpost resulted in it becoming a promising trade town, benefiting from the growing traffic to and from New Vegas, both civilian and military. For all who couldn't or wouldn't want to reach New Vegas, its "Las Vegas on a budget" appeal was revived with the town offering a casino, hotel, several shops and a courier waystation. Unlike its neighbor to the southeast, Nipton, its reputation as a small spot of safety and respite was maintained through having active law enforcement via the town sheriff."
 MONUMENT_202_NAME: "Quarry Junction"
 MONUMENT_202_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_202_NAME$§! was an active quarry pre-war, left deserted since, it could serve useful to be used again to mine limestone deposits. Draglines are present that could make mining much easier at this site. Utilising this Quarry could assist with construction of fortifications."
 MONUMENT_203_NAME: "Ranger Station Echo"
 MONUMENT_203_DESC: "Situated equidistant from the cliffside prospector camp to the northeast and Coyote Mines to the southwest, the station consists of a few structures including a sandbag overlook, shack, and tent. A large radio tower protrudes from the clifftop. The station can be accessed from the west and is inaccessible from any other direction. "
 MONUMENT_204_NAME: "REPCONN Headquarters"
 MONUMENT_204_DESC: "Before the Great War, the building was owned by REPCONN Aerospace, a Nevada-based company that specialized in rocket manufacturing (Rocket Engineering and Production Company of Nevada), located in Henderson.\nAfter the company was acquired by RobCo Industries in 2075, the building received an overhauling, providing greatly increased security so that they would be able to handle classified research. The security took the form of automatic facial recognition monitors, badge scanners, security locks and heavily armed sentry bots for defense. All employees were required to wear identification badges at all times, lest they be flagged as an intruder and harmed by the security system. The third floor was marked executives only, with the employees requiring a daily password to gain access.\nDespite the advanced measure, no amount of automated security could replace humans, however. A mole was delivering information on REPCONN's plasma rifle project undertaken at the headquarters to Poseidon Energy, their competitor. Although the espionage was detected by information services employee Sara Wang, no concrete evidence could be located to take official action against industrial espionage. On the other hand, REPCONN itself was guilty of industrial espionage, as their plasma rifle project relied on the use of Project SEMELE schematics acquired from Poseidon Energy to complete its final stages.\nThe project eventually produced a working prototype, the Q-35 matter modulator, only for the mole, Julia Masters, to conspire with her outside contacts to steal the prototype while it was on its way to the Department of Defense. However, the weapon was never delivered, left in storage in the headquarters after the breakout of the Great War. Following the nuclear apocalypse, the building was left abandoned for decades, haunted by its automated, self-maintaining security systems forever on watch for trespassers. The centuries were not kind, leading to structural damage in the building's shell, but not the electrical system and computers."
 MONUMENT_205_NAME: "REPCONN Test Site"
 MONUMENT_205_DESC: "Before the Great War, REPCONN Aerospace (Rocket Engineering Production Company of Nevada) used the naturally formed canyon to build a secure testing facility, including its landmark rocket launch dome. At least part of the facility had to be rebuilt following a major reentry disaster involving a V29-321G rocket.\nIn the 2070s, the plant was managed by the highly corrupt REPCONN executive Steve Reynolds who cut corners to save money, forcing employees to work overtime and when they quit, hired under-qualified, under-trained replacements.\nIn 2075, as RobCo Industries was negotiating the terms of purchasing the company, REPCONN wanted to demonstrate its technology to gain an advantage in negotiations. However, a disastrous radiation spill occurred, contaminating the area for decades and effectively weakening REPCONN's bargaining position. When the company was acquired by RobCo, its proprietary plasma propulsion system was repurposed as a weapon.\nSometime during the negotiations, the facility received a shipment of two crates of Stealth Boys, but nobody there claimed responsibility for its delivery. While in the midst of trying to solve the supposed error, a male employee secretly stole at least five of the devices and went on an invisible harassment spree, sexually assaulting several female employees and forcing the administration to send the shipment back as is, minus the missing five.\nFollowing the nuclear apocalypse, the test site was abandoned, left to the elements and being picked over by prospectors for the next 200 years, until later becoming infested by feral ghouls. Picking the massive facility apart became a source of revenue for many inhabitants living in the area, most importantly the settlers at the nearby settlement of Novac, in the 23rd century."
 MONUMENT_206_NAME: "Searchlight Airport"
 MONUMENT_206_DESC: "Situated south-southeast of Camp Searchlight, the airport has one runway aligned along the north-south axis, and two east-to-west runways, a control tower, and the main building. The airport runs parallel with Highway 95, with a reinforced tunnel that runs beneath the runways. the collapsed tunnel on the northern side serves as the only means to enter the fenced-in area of the airport. Radscorpions are known to frequent the area."
 MONUMENT_207_NAME: "Searchlight East Goldmine"
 MONUMENT_207_DESC: "Situated southeast of Camp Searchlight and northwest of Fire Root Cavern, the mine consists of a single large cavern containing derelict mining equipment."
 MONUMENT_208_NAME: "Vault 11"
 MONUMENT_208_DESC: "§Y$MONUMENT_208_NAME$§! was one of five vaults constructed in the broader Mojave region assigned to house a civilian population, along with Vault 3, Vault 19, Vault 21, and Vault 34, like the majority of the Vaults, Vault 11 was given parameters to conduct a social experiment; in its case, after the blast doors sealed, the inhabitants were informed by the Vault computer they would have to sacrifice one of their fellow Vault dwellers every year or else everyone in the Vault would be killed.\nThis was a ruse as in truth, if the residents were to refuse, a message from Vault-Tec would play commending the dwellers for their choice, telling them that their "commitment to human life is a shining example to us all" and revealing that no one would be killed. In addition, they were to be informed that as a reward, the Vault door would be unlocked, allowing free passage to and from the Vault with the overseer's permission.\nLocated west of Boulder City and southwest of the 188 Trading Post, prior to entering the Vault, there is a hollowed-out rock to the right of the main door. The reactor and the water purification system of Vault 11 has been damaged by age and the civil war among the dwellers. Therefore, radioactivity and radioactive water are some of the main hazards of the Vault."
 MONUMENT_209_NAME: "Vault 19"
 MONUMENT_209_DESC: "One of five vaults constructed by the Vault-Tec Corporation in the broader Mojave region assigned to house a civilian population, along with Vault 3, Vault 11, Vault 21, and Vault 34, the inhabitants of Vault 19 were segregated into two different colored sectors, red and blue, with limited contact between them. Vault 19 would be unique among the rest in that it had two overseers, one for the Red Sector, one for the Blue Sector.\nThe surface entrance is situated in an abandoned parking lot alongside Nevada State Route 159 between Bonnie Springs and Whittaker farmstead, northeast of Goodsprings. The entrance is concealed by a sewer grate inside the parking lot attendant’s booth. There is an alternate entrance directly into the sulfur caves northwest of Whittaker farmstead. The top floor is mostly intact but most of the lower levels have been cut off by collapsed corridors."
